                    At first I was planing to have a countdown roundshape bomb, then the interaction would be the viewers trying to extinguish the fire before the bomb explode. My second idea was instead of cutting wires, the viewers will have to click the right buttons. But after some exploration, I think the wires work best because it's straight foward and communicate well what the consumer should do.

                    The coundown originally was 30 seonds, but after playing it myself, I found out that 30 seconds is quite long for people whoo want to see what would happend if they didn't cut any wire and time runs out. I also added some details elements, such as the broken wires after cut.
