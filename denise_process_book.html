     At first, I was planning to have a single building in the middle, which muiltiple windows and each window will contains a story. But then I realize that would be a bit hard to keep the viewers attention since that would be around 9 windows. Also, I find it hard to realize which window is clickable without the help of buttons (I don't want to abuse much buttons just yet).
