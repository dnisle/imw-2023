    <h1>R1: A Handmade Web</h1>
        <p1>
            1. J.R. Carpenter's "A Handmade Web" is about the concept of the handmade web, which refers to a period in the history of the internet that occurred in the late 1990s. During this time, people created their own web pages rather than having companies do it for them. Instead of using software, they created the code by hand, and there was a strong sense of personal, creative, and experimental expression. Because it is not as commercial and standardized as the modern internet, the handmade web was a completely different time. The author explores several aspects of it, including its historical significance and value. They highlight how this web era provided a platform for creative expression and experimentation, drawing parallels with handmade print objects like zines and artist books. The author also emphasizes the physicality of the web, as well as the human labor required for online creation.

            2. The idea of a "handmade web" is all about pushing back against the internet becoming too uniform, focused on profit, and impersonal. It goes against the current trend of corporate dominance and standardized web design, reminding us of a time when people used to create their own unique web spaces with creativity and personal expression. It is to neutralize the negative effects of losing control over our personal agency, the diminishing of our online identities, and the limitations imposed by proprietary platforms and commercial interests. Moreover, It challenges the current norms of a highly commercialized and standardized digital landscape by advocating for a return to individual web crafting and experimentation. Its goal is to preserve the Internet as a space for personal creativity, diversity, and resistance against corporate control.

            3. Based on my own experience during this class, I'd say hand-coding. My friend said that later on, we can rely on automated website builders or content management systems to work. But since I'm still a beginner, I'm learning to use HTML and CSS to build my webpage.

    <h1>R2: What Screens Want</h1>
        <p>
            1. Frank Chimero's essay gets into the details of screen design. His main point is that screens, like the ones on our computers and phones, all have their unique traits that affect how we use them. These include that screens can interact with us, respond to our actions, and adapt to different situations. Chimero emphasizes the importance of understanding and incorporating these traits when designing. He discusses how we use metaphors and abstractions to simplify digital concepts so they would be easier for people to understand. For instance, when we see icons that resemble trash cans, they provide us with a clear indication of where to place items that we wish to remove. Chimero is concerned about the commercialization of the web and provides an alternative vision that prioritizes user independence, online communities, and happiness. In short, he encourages developers and designers to create technology that serves human needs and aligns with human values. In the end, the article emphasizes that screens are dynamic parts that have a big effect on how we use technology.

            2. Flat design and skeuomorphism represent two different styles in screen design. Flat design is about keeping things simple, with clean and flat visual elements. It's like a modern and neat look without too many fancy details. Skeuomorphism, on the other hand, tries to make digital stuff look and feel like real-world objects. It uses textures and shadows to mimic the physical world. Flat design is favored by people who think it's sleek and modern, while skeuomorphism is liked by those who believe it helps users understand things better, especially if they're used to physical stuff. For me, I think it would depend on what am I making and who am I making it for. Some designers combine both styles to make interfaces that look good and are easy to use. So, maybe it's not about which one is better, but rather what works best for the project and the people who will use it.

            3. The zoopraxiscope was a device used in the 1800s to make still images appear to be in motion. It can be considered as the ancestor of modern animation and film. Back then, it used a spinning glass disc with pictures to create a feeling of motion when lit up. Similar concepts are used in web and interaction design, they use animations and moving graphics to tell stories and make websites or apps more interesting. The idea of the zoopraxiscope, which makes motion appear smooth, can help us design animations that are pleasing to the eye and easy to understand for people using websites and apps. Another idea from filmmaking that we use in digital design is storyboarding. It's like drawing a comic book version of a movie before making the actual film. In digital design, they plan how websites or apps will work by sketching out the user's journey. This helps ensure everything makes sense and flows smoothly for the users.

    <h1>R3: Interface and Interpretation</h1>
        <p>
            1. Johanna Drucker defined "interface" as the space/environment in which humans and machines or humans and information interact. She believes it's not only an environment where people exchange data, but it also has its values, behaviors, and affordances that affect how individuals interact with and perceive that data. Moreover, Drucker says conventional notions of efficiency and transparency are insufficient to describe the interface development process. It is not only about arranging elements in the right places visually, it also involves creating a space for interpretive activity. She thinks that modern interface design lacks humanism because it overlooks unpredictability, inconsistency, and the relative nature of interpretation. Drucker recommends a more critical and humane approach to interface design that exposes and encourages interpretation, rather than focusing solely on the final result.

            2. According to Drucker's notion of "Humanistic Design", it is a method for creating user interfaces that prioritize accommodating users' need for understanding and making sense of data. This requires accepting the fact that all human expressions are inherently ideological actions of interpretation, and interfaces are more than just tools. In humanistic design, they are places where people can have meaningful interactions while discovering new knowledge. Besides, it is an approach to product development in which the focus is placed less on the final product and more on the interpretative processes. , incorporating an awareness of the information's complex, networked, and constantly shifting nature. The goal of Humanistic Design is to reveal the illusion of seamless completeness, which is why it highlights individual interpretations, comparativist and relativist approaches, and fragmentation. rather than simply displaying information, it aims to participate in the processes of creating new knowledge.

            3. While Drucker's article provides valuable insight into the humanistic aspects of interface design, I believe it may be lacking some considerations (based on my Google certificate knowledge lol):

            Accessibility: The article does not fully address the important topic of making interfaces accessible to all users, it should ensure interfaces are accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.
            Usability testing: One of the most important parts of interface design is keeping track of user activity and making improvements depending on their feedback, because, in my opinion, the goal is all about prioritizing the users' feelings while they experience our designs, whether digitally or not.
            Cultural Sensitivity: In a globalized world, interface designers should be aware of and sensitive to a wide range of cultural standards and procedures. Cultural factors that can have a substantial effect on users' experiences are usually ignored.

    <h1>R4: Database as a Symbolic Form</h1>
        <p>
            1. Manovich explores the contrast between databases and narratives, highlighting their importance in the context of new media.  He highlights the superiority of the database form in the digital context, defined by controlled organization and manipulation of elements, frequently exceeding traditional narratives. Because narratives emerge from the purposeful connecting of multiple elements captured in a centralized database, creating new media exemplifies this shift. Manovich emphasizes how the convergence of digital technologies and the database form has affected the creative process. Beyond video games, virtual reality has the potential for interactive, immersive narrative.  Additionally, non-digital categories such as museum displays, participatory theatre, and collaborative online storytelling platforms are all excellent examples of how to develop interactive narratives in modern or future civilizations.

            2. existing digital landscape to the projected emphasis on user-generated content and interactive narratives. The contrast between database and narrative remains, with the former typically taking primacy over the other in contemporary media, just as Manovich said they would. There is still a stronghold for traditional narrative forms, however, their connection to databases is changing. In recent years, there has been a shift away from a simplistic binary in favor of a more subtle interplay between narrative and database aspects. Particularly, privacy and surveillance are two ethical issues that have come to the fore concerning big databases. While his findings remain true, the development of digital culture reveals a complicated relationship between narrative and database structures.

    <h1>R5: My Website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge</h1>
        <p>
            1. I completely agree with Laurel Schwulst's argument regarding personal websites over social media. Personal websites offer much more control over the content and presentation, and they allow for greater creative expression and individuality. Additionally, they provide a platform for archiving one's work for future generations. However, I also believe that social media has its own unique strengths, such as immediate engagement, broad reach, and community building. I think it's important to recognize the roles of both personal websites and social media and to use them in alignment with one's personal goals and values. By integrating both platforms, we can take advantage of the benefits of each, using personal websites for in-depth content and creative expression, and social media for networking, exposure, and community interaction.

            2. My website is like a flower: it needs effort and time to grow to its full potential. Consistent care and attention is required for my digital area to blossom into something lively, like planting a seed and nurturing it to bloom. It evolves and thrives via a steady journey driven by creativity and perseverance. I am gradually shaping it into a fully developed representation of my vision and passion as it becomes stronger and more expansive with each update and refining. It starts off as a seedling but grows into a vibrant and interesting online presence as time goes on, representing my commitment and providing satisfaction to anybody who takes the time to discover its special features.
